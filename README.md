Charmix is a configurable tool to generate project files structure from archetype.

It's simple and support user defined archetypes.

# Warning

This project is under construction!

Roadmap:

- [x] Add script to build package
- [ ] Enable debug prints only in verbose mode
- [x] Implement user defined archetypes
  - [x] Copy only files from manifest instead of all files from special directory
  - [ ] Implement archetype template with script to configure files (i.e set project name)
- [ ] Implement interactive mode
- [ ] Cleanup project files

# How it works?

- install it `npm i -g charmix`
- generate project structure `charmix ts-frontend`

# How to use my own archetype?
