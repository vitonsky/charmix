  - [ ] Copy only files from manifest instead of all files from special directory
  - [ ] Implement archetype template with script to configure files (i.e set project name)
- [ ] Implement interactive mode
- [ ] Add few types of archetypes
- [ ] Cleanup project files
- [ ] Improve project files structure
